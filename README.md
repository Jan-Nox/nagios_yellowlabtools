Hi guys,

use at your own risk. I know that using PHP is not the best solution for this case (huge understatement, I know), but it was 2am and I wanted to finish what I need. 

Feel free to fork, contribute, blah blah bla, but please don't expect it to be perfect. It fits the case that I need right now and it may be rewritten.
